#RealCycle App#


Overview
RealCycle is a React/Redux-based application developed by Vanessa and Behrouz. The app supports sustainability through recycling, aligning with Agenda 2030 goals. It serves an educational purpose, with a primary focus on students.

These points can be exchanged for fictitious rewards from imaginary partners.

Recycling Points: Earn points for each recycled item, promoting a sustainable lifestyle.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
